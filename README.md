# weather-dashboard

A simple and clean weather dashboard for getting the weather essentials. The site loads with Philadelphia since that's where it's made, and the user can enter any city (by name) into the search box and get the weather right now as well as for the next 5 days. Minimal line icons emphasize the descriptive conditions in an easy-to-understand way.
